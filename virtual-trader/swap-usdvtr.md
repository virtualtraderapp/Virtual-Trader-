# ðŸŸ¢ Swap $VTR

#### _About Swap_

_A swap is a type of derivative. It represents an agreement between two parties - two companies, two investors, a company and an investor, among other possibilities - to exchange cash flows based on a reference value, a time frame, and other pre-set conditions and criteria. A swap contract values or not according to these rules and parameters._

#### _Types of swaps_&#x20;

_There are several types of swaps that are usually performed in the market. They change according to the assets or commodities involved in the flow exchange contracts - which are a kind of indexer for the operation._

* _<mark style="color:green;">**Currency swap ->**</mark> In a currency swap, the parties exchange principal and interest in one currency for principal plus interest in a second currency. It is agreed that one party makes payments in one currency and the other party makes payments in the other, at future dates._

_-> To provide users of the crypto ecosystem with the ability to switch between cryptocurrencies and tokens according to their need and convenience, even if it is to make a cheaper transfer of value (as some tokens pay less fees than others). The swap can also be aimed at taking advantage of a well-performing staking opportunity, to get the token needed to test a web3 project or join a metaverse community._

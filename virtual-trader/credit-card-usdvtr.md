# ðŸŸ¢ Credit Card $VTR

#### History

Several companies in the cryptocurrency industry have found crypto debit cards to be the way to make it easier for people to use digital assets for everyday purchases - all without relying on the merchant being willing to accept this form of payment.

The numbers prove that there is demand for these services. In the last quarter of 2021 alone, Visa processed $2.5 billion in cryptocurrency card payments from more than 65 crypto companies that use its flag - a number 70% higher than all transactions made with cards in this category in fiscal 2021.

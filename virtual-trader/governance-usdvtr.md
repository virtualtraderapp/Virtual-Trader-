# 🟢 Governance $VTR

#### _About Governance_

_Governance tokens give holders the right to vote on proposals that govern the development and operations of a blockchain project. Through this method, projects can distribute decision-making power to their communities. This decentralized governance model helps align the interests of token holders with those of the project._

#### _How does the $VTR governance token work?_

_Governance tokens are the primary method for performing decentralized governance in DAOs, DeFi, and decentralized application (DApp) projects. They are generally distributed to active users as a reward for their loyalty and their contributions to the community. In return, token holders vote on key proposals to ensure the healthy development of the projects. Usually, voting takes place via smart contracts. In this case, the results are implemented automatically._

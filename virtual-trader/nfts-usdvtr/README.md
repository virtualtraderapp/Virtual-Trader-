# ðŸŸ¢ NFT's $VTR

_The rise of blockchain technology has come to transform various segments of society, not least in finance and investments. However, the advancement of this resource, coupled with the success that cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) have had, has brought not only new types of investments, but also opened space for new segments to be explored, such as the NFT market._

_The concept of NFTs has won the world after being embraced by well-known figures, which include famous personalities, artists, and big businessmen. Some of these NFTs sell for millions of dollars, while others are more affordable._

#### _A bit about non-fungible tokens_

_When talking about an asset being a non-fungible token, it is a proprietary digital certificate, where anyone can verify its authenticity, but no one can make changes to its record._

_Non-fungible tokens promote a digital transformation in the arts universe, analogous to the changes in various areas in society with digital transformation. In addition, items are increasingly likely to be used in the digital world, as in the case of the metaverse, as more and more items are used through immersive digital environments._

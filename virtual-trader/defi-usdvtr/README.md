# ðŸŸ¢ DeFi $VTR

#### _Before we start the whole methodology behind <mark style="color:green;">Virtual Trader $VTR</mark>, we will address and explore the <mark style="color:green;">DeFi concept</mark>, as it is the basis for several applied technologies._

1. _<mark style="color:green;">**What is DeFi ?**</mark>_\
   _<mark style="color:green;">****</mark>DeFi is the name given to the set of financial services and products, such as loans, transfers, and payment systems, that run on a blockchain, a kind of decentralized and immutable database. As a rule, these solutions are not controlled by intermediaries such as banks or other financial institutions._\
   __\
   _Operations in DeFi protocols are described and executed by algorithms and smart contracts, which are self-executing computer programs. A practical example to visualize how one works is a loan:_\
   __\
   _<mark style="color:green;">**->**</mark> An individual can take money from another person in a ** **<mark style="color:green;">**peer-to-peer negotiation**</mark>. The form of transfer, the amounts, the interest, the collateral and all the details are defined in advance in these automated contracts, and put in place by them. There is no need to go to a bank or other entity, with its salty fees, to intermediate the transaction._\
   __\
   _The main banner of the technology, therefore, is to create a global financial system that is decentralized, independent, cheap, less bureaucratic, and accessible to all._
2.  #### _<mark style="color:green;">DeFi Applications</mark>_

    _See below the main DeFi applications._\
    \
    _<mark style="color:green;">**->Decentralized Exchanges**</mark>_\
    _<mark style="color:green;">****</mark>DEXs, as they are also called, are brokerages where users can trade cryptocurrencies among themselves (peer-to-peer) without intermediaries. On these platforms, everything is controlled by algorithms and smart contracts. They are different from centralized exchanges, which have a team and a company in control, as is the case with Bitcoin Market and Binance, for example. Two examples of DEX are Uniswap (UNI) and PancakeSwap (CAKE)._\
    \
    _<mark style="color:green;">**->Lending Platforms**</mark>_\
    _<mark style="color:green;">****</mark>They function like banks and finance companies, and give users the possibility to take out loans in cryptocurrencies. The difference is that there are no intermediaries, and everything is governed by smart contracts. In general, digital assets must be pledged as collateral to access the funds. MakerDAO and Compound are some examples._\
    __\
    _<mark style="color:green;">**->Stablecoins**</mark>_\
    _<mark style="color:green;">****</mark>These are cryptocurrencies paired to some asset, such as gold, silver, or fiat currencies (dollar, euro, real, and others). Two examples are Tether (USDT) and USD Coin (USDC). Each unit is equivalent to one dollar. This asset class therefore seeks stability, and is not volatile like Bitcoin, Ethereum, and other crypto-assets._

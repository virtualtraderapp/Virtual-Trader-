# ðŸŸ© Applications

#### _Given all the analysis made initially about the DeFi concept, we at <mark style="color:green;">Virtual Trader</mark> will address factors that conclude our application with the concept, starting with:_

* _<mark style="color:green;">**Costs**</mark> -> We will have low application fees, where we make it totally different from banks or other institutions that adopt abusive fees._
* _<mark style="color:green;">**No Borders**</mark>  -> By being a decentralized platform, not governed by banks or even governments, we will condition total liberality to all investors, and regardless of where you are._
* _<mark style="color:green;">**Passive income**</mark> -> When a user lends money to another person, or leaves his assets on some platform to generate liquidity, he receives interest._
* _<mark style="color:green;">**Pseudoanonymity**</mark> -> Unlike what happens in banks, to use DeFi services the user does not need to inform data such as name, address, or social security number. Access is not 100% anonymous because transactions and addresses (identifications for sending and receiving) are registered in blockchains._

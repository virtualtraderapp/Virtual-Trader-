# 🟩 Applications

#### Our main goal at Farm $VTR is to provide liquidity for a token pair through our pool.

<mark style="color:green;">**Example**</mark><mark style="color:green;">:</mark> If you farm a pair of $VTR-Cake, you are putting money in to provide liquidity to the $VTR-Cake swap.

So if an investor buys $VTR with Cake, there has to be someone to deliver the $VTR to her and that someone is the $VTR-Cake pool.

When you put two tokens to farm they become a third token, which is an LP Token, and this token to become your coins again you have to undo the liquidity.

The multiplier represents the amount of $VTR rewards each farm receives.

<mark style="color:green;">**For example:**</mark> if a 1x farm was receiving 1 $VTR per block, a 10x farm would receive 10 $VTR per block.

# ðŸŸ¢ Farm $VTR

#### How does farming work?

If you want to understand the process, know that it involves locking digital assets into smart contracts to generate pools of liquidity in exchange for interest and other rewards. To do this, an investor must deposit units of a cryptocurrency to receive trading fees.

The returns on crypto assets borrowed in DeFi protocols are presented as an annual percentage yield. Therefore, the operation of the mechanism is similar to what occurs in the traditional lending system.

In addition, as more investors add funds to the related liquidity pool, the value of the return earned increases. Some platforms also reward users with additional returns from the protocol's native token, known as a governance token.

These tokens give cryptocurrency owners the ability to have a say in the directions of its development. Thus, they can participate in votes and influence decisions regarding protocols, products, or development roadmaps.

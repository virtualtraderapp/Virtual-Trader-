#### Staking $VTR

_<mark style="color:green;">**Virtual Trader**</mark> uses proof of work to apply staking, where through a network that uses enormous processing power to solve problems, such as validating transactions between strangers on opposite sides of the planet and ensuring that no one is trying to spend the same money twice. Part of the process involves "miners" around the world competing to be the first to solve a cryptographic puzzle. The winner earns the right to add the most recent "block" of verified transactions to the blockchain and, for their work, receives cryptocurrencies in return._

_Many long-term cryptocurrency holders see staking as a way to make their assets work for them, generating rewards rather than sitting moldering in their wallets._

_With staking, there is the added benefit of contributing to the safety and efficiency of the blockchain projects you support. By staking some of your funds, you make the blockchain more resistant to attack and strengthen its ability to process transactions._

# ðŸŸ© Applications

_The p2p industry is rife with competition, and we recognize that as new players, we are surrounded by competition. But, this does not deter us, as we have put plans in place to provide quality service to our users._

_Even bigger platforms have issues handling these things. Our team at VIRTUAL TRADER will work on our business model, using our competitors as a guide to better understand the market. Below, we consider our top competitors, and what we offer we intend to bring to the table to draw customers our way._

#### _Virtual Trader is a P2P online platform that will connect buyers with sellers._

_As we said above, we will use our competitors as a guide in creating a p2p platform to satisfy user needs. For starters, we will incorporate Binanceâ€™s smart chain because instant transactions and low transaction fees are very popular these days._

_Ethereum smart chain is another area that interests us because of the obvious user privacy advantage and because it supports multiple assets. Overall, we are considering multiple blockchain Bitcoin because it is the most traditional and old blockchain with a bitcoin light network._

_Regarding regulatory issues, we have come prepared and intend to position our platform as a trustworthy option out of the many available p2p platforms._

# 🟢 P2P $VTR

#### _After finalizing the DeFi concept, we will now address each principle of our project, starting with P2P:_

1.  _<mark style="color:green;">**P2P or Peer-to-peer network**</mark>_\
    _<mark style="color:green;">****</mark>A P2P network connects roughly equivalent computers on an equal basis, without the mediation of a third computer. P2P differs from client/server networks, where many computers connect to a single, larger server that directs communication within the network._

    _Computers in a peer-to-peer network are usually physically located near each other and run similar network protocols and software. Before home networks became popular, only small businesses and schools built peer-to-peer networks._
2. _<mark style="color:green;">**Web Sharing**</mark>_\
   _<mark style="color:green;">****</mark>A P2P network implements search and data transfer protocols above the Internet protocol. To access a P2P network, you need to download and install a suitable client application. Some applications work only with a P2P network, while others operate across networks._
3. _<mark style="color:green;">**P2P Network Characteristics**</mark>_\
   _<mark style="color:green;">****</mark> In the modern view of peer-to-peer computing, networks extend across the Internet, not just a local home network. Easy-to-use software applications allow technology professionals and lay people to participate. The 7 main features are:_

* _The user interface runs out of a web browser;_&#x20;
* _The system's computers can act as both clients and servers;_&#x20;
* _The software is easy to use and well integrated;_&#x20;
* _The application includes tools to support users who want to create content or add functionality;_&#x20;
* _The application makes connections with other users;_&#x20;
* _The application does something new or exciting; The software supports cross-network protocols such as SOAP or XML-RPC._

# 🟢 Brigde $VTR

#### _About $VTR_

_A blockchain bridge is a protocol that connects two blockchains to allow interactions between them. If you own Bitcoin but want to participate in DeFi activity on the Ethereum network, a blockchain bridge allows you to do so without having to sell your Bitcoin. Blockchain bridges are critical to achieving interoperability within the blockchain space._

#### _Why do we need blockchain bridges?_

_As blockchain technology has developed and expanded, one of the biggest limitations has been the difficulty of different blockchains working together. Each blockchain has its own rules, tokens, protocols, and smart contracts. Blockchain bridges help circumvent this problem and unite crypto ecosystems. An interconnected network of blockchains enables and facilitates the exchange of tokens and data._

#### _Bridge $VTR_

_At Virtual Trader, we will have a bi-directional point, where investors will be allowed to transfer assets in both directions, from one blockchain to another. This will improve interoperability, between layer-1 and layer-2 protocols or even between various sidechains._
